# catchit-android

The goal of the app is to inform the user about the next departure of the selected buses coming from the given stop. Having a timetable of the "common" connections available at hand could be helpful in deciding whether one needs to hurry to "catch it" or rather take it easy as there's enough time or another one is coming soon.
